This is a simple Ansible playbook that is helping me learn the sytem. It stages servers to run Wordpress using nginx, php-fpm, mysql.

The aim later down the track is to use it to configure clusters with a web tier, database tier, caching tier and automatically allow scaling up to support additional load using
a cloud providor such as Digital Ocean or AWS

### Todo

* Add a monitoring system to monitor all the hosts
* Set up caching tier
* Automatically add DNS records
* Add hosts dynamically to a HTTP proxy
